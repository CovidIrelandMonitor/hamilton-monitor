The probability that a given interaction is with Susceptible person is the fraction of people in the population that are Susceptible at that time. When they interact with a Susceptible person, the Susceptible person moves to being Exposed. An interaction with an Exposed, Infectious or Recovered person leads to no change in the system.<p> Exposed people stay in that state for an approximately exponentially random time, with an average given by the model parameters, whereupon they become Infectious. Infectious people stay in that state for an approximately exponentially random time, with an average given by the model parameters, whereupon they become Recovered. Once there are no Exposed or Infectious people left, the epidemic has ended.<p> As the system is stochastic, significant heterogeneity occurs when the number of Exposed and Infectious people is small. When started with a small number of Exposed and Infectious people, there is a chance that the epidemic dies out before it can get going, or that it expands into a full-blown epidemic. Towards the end of a full blown epidemic, there is significant heterogeneity in the time until it ends. The closer the effective replicative value is to 1, the greater this variability."))
